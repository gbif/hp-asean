# Issue 67: New legume species highlights 2020

## *Compiled by Colin Hughes*

*Six new species of Chamaecrista from the Diamantina Plateau, Brazil*

Cota et al.’s (2020) 82-page taxonomic account of the 64 species of *Chamaecrista* from the campos rupestres of the Diamantina Plateau, Minas Gerais, Brazil, adds six new species. These new species further augment the exceptionally high species diversity and endemicity of *Chamaecrista* in the campos rupestres and hint that more species remain to be described in this species-rich genus.

Two of these new species, *C. howardii* and *C. rupertiana* are named in honour of Howard Irwin and Rupert Barneby, who established the modern classification of subtribe Cassiineae and assembled the last major taxonomic account of the New World species.

*Dalea rubriflora – A new red-flowered species from Mexico*

This is the first species in the genus *Dalea* which has permanently ruby red-flowers and is placed in a new Section Rubriflorae. *Dalea rubriflora* is known from a single collection from the state of Zacatecas in Mexico where it grows in oak forest at 2,590 m elevation.

*Two new species of Harpalyce from the Cerrado hotspot in Brazil*

In a lavishly and comprehensively illustrated paper by São-Mateus et al, two new species of the poorly-known Papilionoid genus *Harpalyce* – *H. correntina* and *H. tomb- dorensis* are described from the Brazilian Cerrado. The resupinate flowers with the vexillary lip of the calyx strongly cucullate at its apex are characteristic of section Brasilianae, endemic to Brazil.

*Additions in Indigofera*

With ca. 750 species, *Indigofera* is the third-largest legume genus, and as with all large pantropical genera, new species continue to steadily accrue. Here *I. centralis* is added to a growing tally of recent additions to the genus from Australia. Interestingly, *I. centralis* was first collected be- tween 1877 and 1889 with a specimen lurking in the Melbourne herbarium and only brought to light based on new material collected 100 years later, vindicating the idea that many undescribed species are already in collections!

The diversity of *Indigofera* in the Sino-Himalayan region with > 100 species is also increasing with description of *I. yuanjiangensis*.

*Mimosa carolina from the Brazilian Cerrado*

*Mimosa carolina*, endemic to the northern fringes of the Brazilian Cerrado, adds to the formidable diversity of *Mimosa* species from the Cerrados and Campos Rupestres of Brazil, a major hotspot for the genus with > 200 species. In common with many *Mimosa* species from the fire-prone Cerrado, *M. carolina* is a geoxyle, resprouting from a substantial underground lignotuber or xylopodium and forming a large spreading mat of prostrate shoots.

*Python vine from Guangxi Province in China: Mucuna guangxiensis*

The pantropical/subtropical genus *Mucuna* has ca. 105 species with around 18 species in China and Japan. The new species described here, *Mucuna guangxiensis* forms a large woody twining liana (known locally as python vine) with large woody fruits up to 70 cm long and is only known from the type locality in Guangxi Province in China.

*A new polyploid Neptunia from the Brazilian Caatinga*

Santos-Silva et al’s paper describing a new species of *Neptunia* (Caesalpinioideae: mimosoid clade) is a classical biosystematics study including cytological, anatomical and morphological data. *Neptunia windleriana* is endemic to Bahia state in Brazil growing in open Caatinga subject to seasonal flooding along the São Francisco River.

*A new wild Phaseolus bean species from Costa Rica*

The discovery and description of this new species of *Phaseolus* from Costa Rica emphasizes that there are still many new species to be described even of wild relatives of important pulse crops like *Phaseolus* beans. In common with the majority of newly described species, *P. albicarminus* is a globally rare endemic, known from just three populations on the western flanks of the Talamanca range in Costa Rica.

*Two new prostrate subshrub Stylosanthes species from Bahia, Brazil*

*Stylosanthes*, with ca. 65 species, is a notoriously difficult genus taxonomically and it is encouraging that new taxonomic work on the genus is underway in Brazil, where the majority of the species occur. This has resulted in two new species of prostrate subshrubs endemic to the Serra Geral and Chapada Diamantina in Bahia.

*Tachigali inca, a new species from the western Amazon*

*Tachigali inca*, newly described this year by Huamantupa-Chuquimaco et al., is a 40 m tall tree in terra firme forests of the western Amazon of Brazil, Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by unusual large cylindrical slightly ribbed ant domatia immersed in the leaf rachis. The presence of ants with strong formic acid is indicated by the common names Tachi (Brazil) and Tangarana (Peru).

*A treasure trove of new Tephrosia species from Australia*

The epithet of the distinctive new species *T. cardiophylla* from the Kimberley sandstones of north-west Australia, is derived from the Greek kardia (heart) and –phyllus (-leaved) in reference to the emarginate apex of the heart- shaped terminal leaflets. Ryonen Butcher reports that she is in the process of describing 35 new *Tephrosia* taxa, mainly from western Australia and the Northern Territory, so there are many more species to come soon.
