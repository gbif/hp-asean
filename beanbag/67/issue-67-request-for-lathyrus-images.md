# Issue 67: Request for *Lathyrus* images

### *Greg Kenicer*

Greg Kenicer (Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh) is looking for **images of *Lathyrus*** to illustrate a horticultural monograph of the genus. If you can help, by providing images of wild species – particularly those from Turkey and the wider Eastern Mediterranean and ‘Near East’, Russia, China and North America, he would be very grateful. All images will be fully credited to the photographer.

This is a full-colour book produced by the Royal Horticultural Society as part of their ‘Complete Guides’ series. Although *Lathyrus odoratus* is the main focus (written by Roger Parsons), it is also the first book to provide a comprehensive overview of the wider genus for the general public, so an excellent chance to show the diversity of this fascinating group. It includes short accounts for each species, including a full-colour image, which is where we need your help. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.

If you think you can provide images from your local area or fieldwork. please send them (e.g. on wetransfer or similar), with your preferred wording for credit to Greg on: <gkenicer@rbge.ac.uk>, before February the 15th.

Many thanks in advance,  
Greg
