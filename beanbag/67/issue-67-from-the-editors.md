# Issue 67: From the Editors

The Bean Bag started in 1974 on the initiative of Charles (Bob) Gunn and Richard Cow- an and the first printed issue was distributed 45 years ago in May 1975. The aim of the annual newsletter is to keep legume researchers informed about new publications, events and projects focused on the systematics of the family Leguminosae.

We warmly thank Brigitte Marazzi, previous editor of the Bean Bag, for all her hard work compiling the newsletter over the last five years, and especially for transforming it into a much more colourful and well-illustrated format. We also thank Gwilym Lewis at Kew for help with checking this issue and supporting the continued archiving of the Bean Bag. Finally, we thank the legume community and our many contributors for sharing their time and insights.
