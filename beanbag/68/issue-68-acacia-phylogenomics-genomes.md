# Acacia Phylogenomics & Genomes  

**Daniel Murphy**, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, Australia  

*Dr. Dan Murphy* would like to draw attention to other legume researchers that two projects investigating the phylogenomics and genomics of *Acacia* are being led by a team of researchers based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, with support from the Genomics for Australian Plants (GAP) Initiative and in collaboration with *Acacia* researchers from other research institutions.

A new project, started in 2022, will generate a backbone phylogeny of Australia’s largest flowering plant genus, *Acacia*, including close mimosoid legume relatives as outgroups. A selection of species representing all major evolutionary lineages of *Acacia*, previously discovered in molecular phylogenies and morphological classification, is initially being sampled for a phylogenomic dataset using the Angiosperm353 baitset, and is expected to contribute to the ultimate aim of a new formal classification of the genus. A second project, to publish a draft genome for *Acacia pycnantha* (Australia’s official floral emblem), is currently being finalised for publication (the mitome and plastome sequences and structural diversity were published [here](https://doi.org/10.46471/gigabyte.36): <https://doi.org/10.46471/gigabyte.36>).  

Both of these projects are intended to generate publicly accessible, genome-level reference datasets for *Acacia* research (e.g., in conservation genetics, invasive species biology, ecological studies and agro-forestry) as well as a co-ordinated approach to *Acacia* systematics research, and contribute to our understanding of the evolution of this major lineage of the Australasian flora.
