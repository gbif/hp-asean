### ***A Look Inside the Stems of the Charismatic Genus Wisteria***

**Rosa Nejapa**, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), México  

***Wisteria is a well-known*** charismatic genus of lianas naturally occurring in temperate zones of eastern Asia and the eastern USA (however, it is now cultivated across the world given its ornamental value). Previous researchers studied anatomical stem features in genus *Wisteria*, especially in *W. sinensis* because of the presence of successive cambia. However, there is a controversy around the origin of successive cambia since different origins have been proposed for *W. sinensis*.  

For my bachelor’s thesis, under guidance of Dr. Marcelo R. Pace (Instituto de Biología, UNAM, México) and in collaboration with Dr. Pablo A. Cabanillas (Cátedra de Dendrología, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Forestales, UNLP, Argentina), we collected ornamental material from *W. sinensis* in Argentina and the USA, taking advantage of the wide distribution of this cultivated species.  

In addition, thanks to loans from the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute (TWTw) wood collection from Tsukuba, Japan, we obtained stems derived from natural populations of *W. brachybotrys* and *W. floribunda*. The work carried out helped us to clarify the origin and development of the successive cambia and to check whether this cambial variant could be a synapomorphy of the genus.  

In this study, we demonstrate that three species of *Wisteria* develop successive cambia in their stems. Through ontogeny carried out with samples cut from apical portions to the thick portions of the stems, we identified that the successive development of cambia was linked to the topological position of the pericyclic fibres, which is a distinct cambial variant for the genus.
