# Open Tree of Life - Legume Node 

Coordinators:  
**Vanessa Terra**, Universidade Federal de UberlaÌ‚ndia, Brazil  
**Joe Miller**, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Denmark  

***Open Tree of Life*** (OToL) is a project to construct a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees. Until a fully sampled single phylogenetic analysis is available for the legumes, the OToL can provide the best phylogenetic estimates for the family. Currently only about 30% of the legume species have been integrated into the OToL. The goal of the working group is to curate the Leguminosae/Fabaceae OToL tree with the latest phylogenies to create a resource for the legume community. Because it is very easy to import a phylogeny from [Treebase](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html) into OToL for further curation, legume systematists are encouraged to deposit their published trees in Treebase, where they can then be used to improve the OToL synthetic tree. Please see the [legume portal](https://www.legumedata.org/working-groups/OToL) for more information.
