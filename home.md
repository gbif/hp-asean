WHAT IS A+BIGNET

Natural history collections (NHCs) are a data-rich resource and are considered as a cornerstone of biodiversity science. These invaluable collections, whether housed in public or private museums, universities, and research institutions, have long been identified to play a crucial role in research, education, and biodiversity conservation. Specimens effectively capture taxonomic, and functional diversity, representing species' environmental niches more efficiently than community science observations. Despite their significance, NHC data are often underutilized in biodiversity conservation due to decentralization and lack standardization, complicating access and analysis. The ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity has established the ASEAN Biodiversity Information Generators Network initiative, which is a network of natural history museums and biodiversity-based institutions in the ASEAN region.
Backed by its Scientific Advisory Committee, A+BIGNet seeks to enhance collaboration and data interoperability among natural history museums and biodiversity-based institutions across the ASEAN region, promoting open access for research on species and ecosystems.
