# Issue 68: From the Editors

The Bean Bag started in 1974 on the initiative of Charles (Bob) Gunn and Richard Cowan and the first printed issue was distributed 47 years ago in May 1975. The aim of the annual newsletter is to keep legume researchers informed about new publications, events and projects focused on the systematics of the family Leguminosae. 

Bean Bag Number 68 is another bumper issue reporting on diverse aspects of another vibrant and busy year of global legume systematics research. One of the exciting developments during 2021 was the launch of a new Legume Data Portal, which also posts news items of interest to the legume research community. You can read more about the Portal in this issue of the Bean Bag. 

We thank Anne Bruneau for compiling reports from the Legume Phylogeny Working Group (LPWG) meeting in September 2021, which are reproduced here in edited form. Thanks also to Gwilym Lewis at Kew for help with checking this issue and facilitating the archiving of the Bean Bag in the Kew Research Repository, which was completed in 2021. Finally, thanks to you, the legume community as a whole, and our many contributors for sharing their time and insights.

Earlier issues of the BB (1975 to 2021) are available via the [Kew Research Repository](https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/publications-and-reports/publications/the-bean-bag)
