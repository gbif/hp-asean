# New Legume Species Highlights 2021  

**Compiled by Colin Hughes**, University of Zürich, Switzerland  

***New legume species*** continue to be described at a steady pace from all continents across the globe. Even in well-studied genera which contain important pulse crops, new species continue to be discovered including the species of *Arachis* and *Cicer* described in 2021 which are highlighted here as potentially important crop wild relatives of peanut and chickpea. As might be expected, it is mainly the globally rare species that remain to be discovered in the field and many of the new species highlighted here are narrowly restricted endemics that are threatened or in some cases, critically endangered. It is also notable that newly described species are very often in species-rich genera from areas of high species diversity for those genera. The species highlighted here provide a flavour of the new discoveries of 2021. A full list of taxonomic papers is in the 2021 Legume Bibliography at the end of this issue of the Bean Bag. 

### Two new ***Adesmia*** species from southern Brazil 

*Adesmia miottoae* Cobra, Iganci & Fort.-Perez is a prostrate perennial herb, endemic to the highland grasslands of SE Santa Catarina and NE Rio Grande do Sul in S Brazil. The species epithet honours Professor Silvia Terezinha Sfoggia Miotto for her contribution to studies of *Adesmia* and other legumes, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In addition, the same authors describe a second new species, *Adesmia subtropicalis* Cobra, endemic to Rio Grande do Sul and named with reference to its occurrence in transition areas between Pampa (temperate) and Mata Atlantica (tropical).

### ***Arachis inflata***, a peanut with inflated fruits 

Despite thorough exploration and characterisation of species and diversity of the crop legume genus *Arachis*, there are still many field collecting gaps. Recent fieldwork in eastern Bolivia has revealed an interesting and very unusual new species that has been named *Arachis inflata* Seijo, Atahuachi, C. E. Simpson & Krapov. The specific epithet, *inflata*, refers to its fruits which have conspicuous air chambers in the pericarp, giving a bullate external appearance, a fruit type that is unique in the genus *Arachis*.

### A critically-endangered ***Otholobium*** from the western Cape, South Africa 

Like many new plant species discoveries, *Otholobium outrampsii* C.H. Stirton & du Preez is a narrowly distributed endemic, known from just a single locality in the western Cape of South Africa. Based on field surveys it is judged to be Critically Endangered. The specific epithet honours the members of the Outramps Group of the Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers (CREW) Programme, who champion the protection of the rare and threatened plants of the southern Cape.

### A critically endangered new species of ***Antheroporum*** from northern Thailand 

*Antheroporum* is a small Papilionoid genus of c. five species in tribe Millettieae ranging from China to Indo-China and Thailand, characterised by unusually long petal claws. Like many new field discoveries, *Antheroporum puudjaae* Mattapha & Tetsana is known only from the type locality, is apparently narrowly endemic in limestone mountains in northern Thailand and is categorized as Critically Endangered. The species was named in honour of Pachok Puudjaa, a long-time collector of plants for the Flora of Thailand project.

### The hyper-diverse genus ***Astragalus*** just keeps on growing 

It is perhaps no surprise that *Astragalus*, the largest genus of flowering plants with > 3000 species, is still growing. A steady stream of new species continues to be discovered and described in this hyper-diverse genus. 
Here, two of the recently described species are highlighted: *Astragalus taledensis* P. Yan & Huan Zhang, an unusual and distinctive species narrowly endemic in NE Xinjiang Province, China distinguished by its simple leaves and prostrate stems, and *Astragalus wiesneri* Maassoumi & Pahlevani, a rare species, known only from the type locality in alpine habitats at 3500 – 3850 m elevation in the S Zagros Mountains of Iran.

### A new species of ***Campylotropis*** from SW China 

*Campylotropis* of tribe Desmodieae, subfamily Papilionoideae comprises ca. 37 species centred in SW China which harbours 32 species, of which 20 are endemic, mostly in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces. An additional species, *Campylotropis luquanensis* Bo Xu & L.S. Jiang, from that region has recently been described.

### ***Cicer turcicum***, a new close wild relative of chickpea from Anatolia 

The discovery of a new annual wild species in the genus *Cicer* is especially exciting because, as a crop wild relative, it has important potential for genetic improvement of the domesticated pulse crop, chickpea, *Cicer arietinum* L., or for de-novo domestication in its own right. *Cicer turcicum* Toker, J. Berger & Göktürk is a narrowly restricted endemic, known from just a single population in SE Anatolia in Turkey, quite distant from any other Cicer species. Cicer turcicum is an annual plant, closely related to *C. arietinum* and shows enhanced heat tolerance and resistance to bruchid seed beetles compared to chickpea.

### ***Harpalyce greuteri***: A new serpentine endemic from NE Cuba

*Featured on the cover of Issue 68.*   
Cuba harbours 14 of the 34 species of *Harpalyce*, most of them serpentine endemics growing in xeromorphic, thorny or sub-thorny thickets. *Harpalyce greuteri* R. Rankin & P. A. González newly described in 2021 adds yet another serpentine endemic to this impressive tally of Cuban endemics. While the red standard petal colour is not unusual in *Harpalyce*, this new species differs from other red-flowered species in having an unusual black keel and partially black wing petals.

### ***Mimosa*** – The census continues 

Documentation of the high diversity of *Mimosa* species in the Brazilian cerrado and campos rupestres continues with the addition of *Mimosa pseudoracemosa* T.P. Mendes, Marc. F. Simon & M.J. Silva. In common with many fire-resistant mimosas, *M. pseudoracemosa* is a geoxyle with the leaves arising directly from the underground xylopodium. The species is probably restricted to the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, in northern Goiás State, Brazil.

### ***Lespedeza danxiaensis***, narrowly endemic on the summit of Mount Danxia, in Guangdong 

*Lespedeza danxiaensis* Q. Fan, W.Y. Zhao & K.W. Jiang was discovered during field work in 2020. It is only known from ca. 100 individuals from the summit area of Mount Danxia in the Danxiashan National Nature Reserve in Guangdong Province, China and is readily distinguished by its unusual leathery leaflets.

### A new ***Hedysarum*** from Uzbekistan 

Of the c. 160 species of *Hedysarum*, more than half are distributed in central Asia with especially high levels of endemism in the Tien Shan Mountains and the SW Pamir-Alay in Uzbekistan where this new species is narrowly endemic. *Hedysarum sunhangii* Juram. & Tojibaev is named in honour of the Chinese botanist, Prof. Hang Sun, who promoted botanical collaboration between Uzbekistan and China.

### ***Polhillia stirtoniana***  

Legume workers will be delighted to see this new species, *Polhillia stirtoniana* du Preez named in honour of Charles Stirton for his work on Cape legumes and for his assistance in the formation of the Overberg Renosterveld Conservation Trust and establishment of the Haarwegskloof Private Nature Reserve and research centre in South Africa. The binomial is even more apt given that the genus *Polhillia* was established by Charles Stirton in honour of the eminent legume systematist Roger Polhill. This species, alongside two others newly described, was published as part of an excellently detailed and abundantly illustrated taxonomic monograph of *Polhillia* that brings the number of species in the genus to 11.

### A new ***Indigofera*** from the Cape biodiversity hotspot 

Several legume genera form large species radiations in the Fynbos vegetation of the Cape Flora of South Africa, including a large endemic clade of the genus *Indigofera* with ca. 90 species. *Indigofera wenholdiae* du Preez & Schrire is the first of several new species that are being described for this clade.
