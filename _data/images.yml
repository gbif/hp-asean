# SOME NOTES TO MAKE THESE CONSISTENT:
# name: use the common name - it is easier to type
#   src: download the image in high resolution and save it locally. This is more robust
#   caption: use the "Suggested attribution" associated with the image on the GBIF occurrence, but keep links to the site when possible.
